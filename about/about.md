Hello! I'm Noah, an undergraduate at UC Berkeley double-majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (conc. Data Science). I love anything numerical, from automation to music, as well as learning, teaching, and developing relationships with people. I've worked on both individual and team projects related to programming and robotics, and look forward to many more!
